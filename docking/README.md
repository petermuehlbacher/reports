# Protein-Protein Docking

A report on my weekly progress can be found
[here](https://github.com/petermuehlbacher/reports/blob/master/docking/docking.pdf).
It may also serve as an (incomplete) introduction to this topic.

In order to make the
[implementation](https://github.com/petermuehlbacher/reports/tree/master/docking/implementation)
more accessible I created an annotated
[IPython notebook](https://github.com/petermuehlbacher/reports/blob/master/docking/implementation/proteindocking.ipynb).
