# Protein-Protein Docking

My report can be found
[here](https://github.com/petermuehlbacher/reports/blob/master/docking/paper/docking.pdf).

In order to make the
[implementation](https://github.com/petermuehlbacher/reports/tree/master/docking/implementation)
more accessible I created an annotated
[IPython notebook](https://github.com/petermuehlbacher/reports/blob/master/docking/implementation/proteindocking.ipynb).
